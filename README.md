# Supersonic_Test
 
Since I hadn't worked on such a tight deadline yet, I didn't know which one to tackle first. 

I started drawing UML the old-fashioned way. Thinking about the future expansion of the project, etc. However, the emphasis in the test was not only on the code part, but also on visuals (animations, VFX). That's why I spent quite a lot of time on detailed description of mechanics, I realised that I would not be able to complete the test project in such a way. 

I started to do everything quickly. Completely ignoring architecture and optimisation issues. Since I don't know what the evaluation criteria are, I decided to just meet the deadline by completing as many tasks as possible. 

Some animations I realised with Animation, some with Dotween. 

All VFX are done in Particle System. 

If you are interested in more R&D part and want to see the clean code, architecture and patterns, I suggest you to take a look at this project
